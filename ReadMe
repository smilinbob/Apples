-------------Gameplay-------------
----------------------------------

  Apples is an adaptation of the card game Apples to Apples, and gameplay is quite similar.
  At the begining of the game(or when a player joins, they are dealt 7 red cards. The red cards
  are often nouns, but can also be a concept or idea. At the begining of each round a judge is 
  selected then a green cardis drawn. The green cards are adjectives. Each player must then play
  one of their green cards that represents the green card. Once all cards are recieved, or time 
  runs out, the red cards are revealed. The judge must then pick one of the green cards they
  like best. The judge may use any criteria to decide. They may choose the most true, or maybe
  the one they think is funniest. The player that played that red card recieves the green card and
  a point. The remaining red cards played are removed from the game, and play continues onto the 
  next round.
  
  At the begining of each round, the bot will message each player their list of red cards and the 
  green card for the round. To seect a card, the player simply messages the card number back to
  the bot.
  
  When all cards are submitted, the red cards will be revealed in the channel, as well as messaged 
  to the judge. The judge may make their selection either by saying the number of the card in the 
  channel, or by messaging it to the bot.
  
  Please see Commands section for more information on game functions.
